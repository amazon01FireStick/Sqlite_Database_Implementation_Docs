## What is SQLite Database? 
SQLite Database is an open-source database provided in Android which is used to store data inside the user’s device in the form of a Text file. We can perform so many operations on this data such as adding new data, updating, reading, and deleting this data. SQLite is an offline database that is locally stored in the user’s device and we do not have to create any connection to connect to this database.
